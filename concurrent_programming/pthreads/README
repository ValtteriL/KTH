Simple program that finds all palindromic words in a given words file and writes them to a file called palindromics.
The words file has to be named words.

usage: ./a.out <number of worker threads>

note: if there are no workers, no work will be done! ;-)

NOTE: this program is highly inefficient, because it uses lots of file i/o.
in /memory is a version which reads the words file ony once and is over 10 times faster!
