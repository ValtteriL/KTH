 Unfair solution to repair station
 Unfair because it might starve some threads waiting for reparation by giving precedence 
 to same type of vehicles that are being repaired
 
 if we used notifyall() instead of notify(), the solution would be even more unfair,
 because then there would be less chances for different type of vehicle to enter the reparation.
 It might make the program more effective though
